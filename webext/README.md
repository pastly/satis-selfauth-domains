A Firefox / Tor Browser web extension for self-authenticating traditional
domains (SAT domains) and alternate services.

The extension requires the [securityInfo API][], which first appeared in FF 62.
Tor Browser will have this API no later than July 2019 (when the next [ESR][]
of FF is released).  Tor Browser Alpha 8.5.X has this API.
