<h3>About</h3>
<p>A <b>self-authenticating domain name</b> is one that incorporates into itself the
information needed to authenticate a connection to the domain.</p>

<p>In practice, the self-authenticating address is (primarily) a cryptographic
public key that verifies a cryptographic signature over information describing
connection information.</p>

<p>A <b>self-authenticating traditional (SAT)
    domain name</b>, therefore, begins as a traditional domain (such
as example.com) and somehow binds to itself everything
needed for self-authentication. For example, prepending a
self-authenticating domain as a subdomain of a traditional
domain.</p>

<p>If <a href="http://{onion}.onion">http://{onion}.onion</a>
is the address of a Tor onion service, then {onion}.onion is a
<b>self-authenticating domain</b>.</p>

<p>As such,
<b>{onion}onion.{origin}</b>
is a <b>self-authenticating traditional domain</b> because a traditional domain
is bound to a self-authenticating domain (binding {origin} with
{onion}).</p>

<p>A <b>self-authenticating address (SATA)</b> is a URL joining a traditional address
(http://example.com/foo/bar) and a self-authenticating domain. They are joined either:
<ul>
    <li>as a SAT domain (as described above)</li>
    <li>by appending the self-authenticating address in a query string</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Extending the previous example, a SATA of <a href="https://{origin}">
    https://{origin}</a>
is <a href="https://{origin}?onion={onion}">https://{origin}?onion={onion}</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of which SATA format is used, the <b>SAT domain</b> format is
considered <b>canonical form</b>.</p>
