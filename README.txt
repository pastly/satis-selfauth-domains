Jan 2019 note: The extension saw a massive overhaul that is now getting commit
to this repository:
 - Self-auth names now look like [56char]onion.foo.com as opposed to
   [56char].onion.foo.com
 - Support for verifying self-auth names in alt-svc's
 - Support for verifying onion address in alt-svc's
 - No longer require a Firefox patch
 - Relax some verification requirements to make adoption more likely to happen
   (for example, requiring the self-auth name to be in the TLS certificate)
