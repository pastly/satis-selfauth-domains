Jan 2019 note: The extension saw a massive overhaul that is now getting commit
to this repository:
 - Self-auth names now look like [56char]onion.foo.com as opposed to
   [56char].onion.foo.com
 - Support for verifying self-auth names in alt-svc's
 - Support for verifying onion address in alt-svc's
 - No longer require a Firefox patch
 - Relax some verification requirements to make adoption more likely to happen
   (for example, requiring the self-auth name to be in the TLS certificate)

                Contents
                --------

satis.system33.pw/

  Website files used in the video demonstration

webext/

  A Firefox web extension for checking alliuminated domain names.

Alliuminated domain.webm

  A video demonstrating the product of (an older version of) these files. See
  its README for more information.

nginx.conf.tmpl

  The starting point for an nginx config file. When parsed, it configures nginx
  to add the necessary HTTP headers to its responses for our extension to work.

tor/

  A git submodule pointing to the Tor code that has the necessary changes to
  generate these signatures. If you want to get it manually for some reason,
  it's the branch selfauth-sig-0.3.5.7 at https://github.com/pastly/public-tor

tor.selfauth-sig-0.3.5.7.tar.xz

  The Tor code as of my branch selfauth-sig-0.3.5.7 in case this is easier for
  you than a submodule.

update-satis-sig-nginx-conf.sh

  Take the signatures generated by Tor, combine them with the nginx config
  template, and outputs the final nginx template.
